Claim messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    POST /v1/{project_id}/queues/{queue_name}/claims

This operation claims a set of messages (up to the value of the
``limit`` parameter) from oldest to newest and skips any messages
that are already claimed. If no unclaimed messages are available, the API
returns a ``204 No Content`` message.

When a client (worker) finishes processing a message, it should delete
the message before the claim expires to ensure that the message is
processed only once. As part of the delete operation,
workers should specify the claim ID (which is best done by simply
using the provided href). If workers perform these actions, then if a
claim simply expires, the server can return an error and notify
the worker of the race condition. This action gives the worker a
chance to roll back its own processing of the given message
because another worker can claim the message and process it.

The age given for a claim is relative to the server's clock. The claim's
age is useful for determining how quickly messages are getting
processed and whether a given message's claim is about to expire.

When a claim expires, it is released. If the original worker failed
to process the message, another client worker can then claim the message.

.. note::
   Claim creation is best-effort, meaning the worker
   may claim and return less than the requested number of messages.

The ``ttl`` parameter specifies how long the server waits before releasing
the claim. The ttl value must be between 60 and 43200 seconds (12 hours).
You must include a value for this parameter in your request.

The ``grace`` parameter specifies the message grace period in seconds.
The value of ``grace`` value must be between 60 and 43200 seconds (12 hours).
You must include a value for this parameter in your request.
To deal with workers that have stopped responding (for up to 1209600 seconds
or 14 days, including claim lifetime), the server extends the lifetime of
claimed messages to be at least as long as the lifetime of the
claim itself, plus the specified grace period. If a claimed message
would normally live longer than the grace period, its
expiration is not adjusted.
