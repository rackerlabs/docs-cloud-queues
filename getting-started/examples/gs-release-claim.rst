.. _gs-release-claim:

Releasing a claim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The release claim operation immediately releases all messages associated with a
specified claim ID. This action makes all remaining, undeleted messages
associated with the claim available to be processed by other workers.

Following is the operation template:

.. code::

     DELETE {endpoint}/queues/{queue_name}/claims/{claim_id}

This operation is useful when a worker is performing a graceful
shutdown, fails to process one or more messages, or is taking
longer than expected to process messages and wants to make the
remainder of the messages available to other workers.

Following are examples of a release claim request and response:

**cURL relesase claim request**

.. code:: bash

     curl -i -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/queues/samplequeue/claims/51ca011c821e7250f344efd6 \
     -H "Content-type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Auth-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
     -H "Client-ID: e58668fc-26eb-11e3-8270-5b3128d43830"  \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "X-Project-Id: $TENANT_ID"
